code omfgggggg why does nothing work omfgggggg\n#made a number system to diffirentiate different inputs depending on the 10s place\n#got it to run by having it send a input with a 10 value of 0, then a input with a 10 value of 1 followed by player id\n#everything sucks and my day is ruined, when more than 4 inputs are sent the server gets fuzzed\n#nope just orginization\n# what was i on when i wrote that omfg whyyy also why did i use math to plot the progress instead of a grid and a bunch of values\n#ok so it wasent a total waste i have a framework all i need to do is change around a few things and use a differet number system\n#number sustem changed to the 10s place being the player id and then the input\n#0 is assighned to end the game\n# finnaly got this shit to work omfggggggg
